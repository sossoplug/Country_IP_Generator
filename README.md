# IP Generator Script

## Usefulness:
This script is designed to generate IP addresses for a specified country, ensuring that the IPs generated fall within the known IP ranges for that country. The script also tracks its progress to avoid regenerating the same IPs in subsequent runs. It provides options to display the generated IPs on the console or save them to a file. The script is optimized for performance by utilizing multithreading.

   - `PROGRESS_TRACKER_PATH`: Path to a file where the script will save its progress.
   - `NUMBER_OF_THREADS`: The number of threads to use for parallel processing.
   - `SAVING_FILE_PATH`: The path where the output file with the generated IPs should be saved.
   - `COUNTRY_DATA_PATH`: Path to the file containing IP ranges for different countries.
   - `LOG_OUTPUT_FILEPATH`: Path to save the log file.



2. **Setting Up a Virtual Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv venv`
   - Activate the virtual environment:

4. Run the script: `python main.py`


5. Follow the on-screen prompts to specify your preferences and start the IP generation process.



## Data Files:

1. **country_ip_ranges.json**: This file contains the IP ranges for different countries. It has a basic structure as shown below:
```json
{
  "Canada": [
    {"start": "x.x.x.x", "end": "y.y.y.y"},
    {"start": "a.a.a.a", "end": "b.b.b.b"},
    ...
  ],
  "USA": [
    {"start": "c.c.c.c", "end": "d.d.d.d"},
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
